## End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end data engineering project** developed for learning purposes. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a complete data pipeline using **Databricks** and applied the **Factory Design Pattern** to manage the workflow efficiently.

### Purpose:
The primary goals of this project are to:
1. **Understand the Databricks Workflow**: Learn how to build and orchestrate a data engineering pipeline within the Databricks environment, integrating various tools and processes for data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL).
2. **Apply Design Patterns**: Implement the **Factory Design Pattern** to structure the workflow and ensure that the code is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
3. **Hands-on Data Engineering**: Simulate real-world data engineering scenarios by working with large datasets, automating ETL processes, and optimizing performance.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Extracting raw data from various sources such as APIs, databases, or file systems.
   - Automating data ingestion using Databricks workflows.
2. **Data Transformation**: 
   - Applying transformations and data cleaning techniques to prepare the data for analysis.
   - Leveraging Apache Spark for distributed data processing.
3. **Data Loading (ETL)**: 
   - Loading the transformed data into a target system (such as a data warehouse or data lake).
   - Ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the process.
4. **Factory Design Pattern**: 
   - The project is structured using the Factory Design Pattern, which abstracts and encapsulates the creation of different components in the data pipeline.
   - This pattern makes the workflow more flexible and modular, enabling easier changes and scalability in future extensions of the project.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Databricks**: Used as the platform for orchestrating the end-to-end data pipeline, taking advantage of its integration with Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for scripting and automating the workflows.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing data within the pipeline.
- **Factory Design Pattern**: Applied to the workflow to ensure modular and maintainable code structure.

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Data Pipeline Orchestration**: Learned how to set up and manage data workflows using Databricks, including automation and scheduling of ETL processes.
- **Design Patterns in Data Engineering**: Applied the Factory Design Pattern to keep the pipeline flexible and scalable, ensuring code reusability.
- **Optimization and Scalability**: Gained experience in optimizing the data pipeline for performance, ensuring that it can handle large datasets efficiently.

This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience, providing a strong foundation in **data engineering** while demonstrating how to effectively use **Databricks** and the **Factory Design Pattern** to build efficient, scalable data pipelines.
